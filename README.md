By default [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) has some snippets that I don't like very much, like the ones for JavaScript. So I modified them a bit.

# Installation

If you are on Linux, put the directories into: `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/`. Remember to remove the default snippets in order to avoid duplication.
